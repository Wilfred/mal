System V AMD64 ABI

The calling convention of the System V AMD64 ABI[15] is followed on
Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, and other UNIX-like or POSIX-compliant
operating systems. The first six integer or pointer arguments are
passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9, while XMM0, XMM1,
XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 are used for floating point
arguments. For system calls, R10 is used instead of RCX.[15] As in the
Microsoft x64 calling convention, additional arguments are passed on
the stack and the return value is stored in RAX.

If the callee wishes to use registers RBP, RBX, and R12â€“R15, it must
restore their original values before returning control to the
caller. All others must be saved by the caller if it wishes to
preserve their values.[16]

Unlike the Microsoft calling convention, a shadow space is not
provided; on function entry, the return address is adjacent to the
seventh integer argument on the stack.
